2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock zynq_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.021 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_clk/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_clk_p_0 (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.022 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_clk/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_clk_n_0 (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.057 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_blue/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_p_0[0] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.058 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_blue/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_n_0[0] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.058 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_green/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_p_0[1] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.059 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_green/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_n_0[1] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.062 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_red/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_p_0[2] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#8 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.063 ns between zynq_i/vga2hdmi_0/inst/inst_serializer_red/OSERDESE2_Master/CLK (clocked by clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1) and tmds_data_n_0[2] (clocked by VIRTUAL_clk_5x_zynq_clk_wiz_0_1). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock zynq_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin zynq_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
